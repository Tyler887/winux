## Install
An easy way to install Winux is to use Windows PowerShell, which does not require any additional software:

scoop install git
scoop bucket add winux https://github.com/Tyler887/winux-scoop.git
scoop install winux/winux

Winux might be detected as a virus, called `Trojan:Win32/Wactac.b!ml`. If this appears in Windows Security, then uninstall Winux, and try installing it again. If you still find the same issue, install using Scoop.
